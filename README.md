# Abstract
Extensive imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) of the human cerebellum have been explored but lack evidence from different modalities and scales to explore the spatio-molecular profiles that might be engaged in their formation. Here, we detail procedures from obtaining cerebellar transcriptomic samples from Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), assignment of IDPs into samples, predictions of IDPs using gene expression, significance evaluation of genes, linking the gene to IDPs using gene set variation analysis (GSVA).
